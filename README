OpenMCU is a simple Mutli Conference Unit using the H.323 and SIP protocol.
It is known to run on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.

Requires the H323Plus library - see http://www.h323plus.org for more information.
Requires the PTLib library - see http://www.opalvoip.org for more information.
Requires the Sofia-SIP library - see http://www.sofia-sip.sourceforge.net for more information.
Requires the FFmpeg library - see http://www.ffmpeg.org for more information.
Requires the FreeType library - see http://www.freetype.org for more information.
Requires the libyuv library - see http://www.code.google.com/p/libyuv for more information.


2. Features
-----------

The code contains the following features:

- configured by a web interface on port 1420 (use http://host:1420 access)
- supported interface languages: English, Russian
- requires no codec hardware to operate
- supports H.263, H.264, VP8 video codecs
- supports G.711, G.722, G723.1, G.726, iLBC, Speex, SILK, OPUS audio codecs
- can accept multiple connections simultaneously
- several different conferences can be talking place at the same time
  using the 'rooms' feature
- display statistics on calls in progress
- initiate calls from the MCU to remote endpoints
- audio loopback mode echoes back your audio in a specific room. Ideal for
  setup of audio hardware and testing network performance.


3. Operation
------------

OpenMCU works by setting up a H.323 and SIP listener process, and then waiting for
incoming connections.
You call the MCU using the format "room_name@server_name".

New rooms are created automatically and there is a default room for
people who do not specify a room or cannot specify a room (eg NetMeeting).
The default room is called room101.


4. Installation Instructions
