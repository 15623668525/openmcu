3. Operation
------------

OpenMCU works by setting up a H.323 and SIP listener processes, and then
waiting for incoming connections.
You call the MCU using the format "room_name@server_name".

New rooms are created automatically and there is a default room for
people who do not specify a room or cannot specify a room (eg NetMeeting).
The default room is called room101.
